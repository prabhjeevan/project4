# __FLASHBACK__

This is an app created with the MERN stack. I have decided to name it *FLASHBACK* as my purpose behind making this app was to post memories or events that have happened in your life to later look back at them or share with your friends. 



#### __When you first launch the website.__

 * _Very simple intro screen displaying app name and login form. It also has a nav bar which shows an option to sign in or sign up which depends on the user, whether they have an account or not._

Once the user has made an account, they can sign in using their email and password. 

__Here is the display of the homepage once signed in.__

The user is welcomed with a page of their feed which is endless scroll as long as users have made posts. In the future I plan on implenting a follow and unfollow feature where the users feed will only be populated with posts from other users who they follow. 
The nav bar has also been manipulated to show features which are available to logged in users. Creating a post and going to your profile are two of the feautres that a registered user will have access to.
